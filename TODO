# TODO

## High Prio

* Deal with how to display single images properly. They're too big.
* Add recent photography and blog posts to main page.
* Social icons.
* Fixup post date.
* Experiment with cards for images, titles, and image counts, in columns gallery.
* Touchup nav bar.
* Config driven theme colors.
* Photo post auto gallery setting, if used, we'll default to display a gallery of some kind. Maybe columns.
* Add shortcode for single image display, as shortcode-gallery is not good at this, makes them too large. Simplest might just be a "show every image in large size" shortcode.

## Low Prio

* Experiment with adding a custom taxonomy for color theme in photography posts, manually assigned, but then sort posts on this. (optionally for tags/sections?)
* Get the footer at the bottom of the viewport? Or will this be a non-issue once we fill in main page.
* Add additional shortcodes. Zoomwall, etc. Used has the option of how to render their content.
