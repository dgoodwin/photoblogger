# TODO

## High Prio

* Pagination, it's soon going to be too big to have everything on one page. By year? X posts at a time?
* Find a way to communicate post title and count of images.
* Deal with how to display single images properly. Two clicks to open in lightbox.
* Add blog posts to main page.
* Social icons.
* Fixup post date.
* Config driven theme colors.
* Auto-open single image photo posts in lightbox? Or show them in a better size?

## Low Prio

* Experiment with adding a custom taxonomy for color theme in photography posts, manually assigned, but then sort posts on this. (optionally for tags/sections?)
  * Justified gallery can sort on color codes.
* Get the footer at the bottom of the viewport? Or will this be a non-issue once we fill in main page.
